        <h2>Do China’s Dam Plans Hold Water for Low Carbon Development?</h2>
    </div>

    <div id='text'>
        <p>When it comes to climate change, China presents a conundrum. It is the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter and consumes more coal than the rest of the world combined. But at the same time, the Middle Kingdom also has the largest installed hydropower, wind and solar capacity in the world.  Indeed, Chinese policymakers are taking climate change seriously. In the <strong>12th Five-Year Plan</strong> (FYP), the Chinese government has laid out a strategy to reduce its carbon intensity by <strong>17</strong> percent by 2015. As part of this, China will increase non-fossil fuel energy to <strong>11.4</strong> percent of its total energy consumption, though an additional <strong>160 GW</strong> hydropower installed capacity, along with ambitious expansion in renewables and nuclear. </p>

        <p>China’s conundrum goes even further as one of the nation’s indispensable solutions to climate change—hydropower—is likely to wreak havoc with China’s water and ecological systems. Over the next 3 years, China plans to build at least <strong>60 dams</strong>, concentrated in the country’s southwest. By 2015, the country’s hydropower capacity will reach <strong>284 GW</strong>—more than that of Europe—and by 2020, <strong>380 GW</strong>.  To reach these ambitious goals, there must to be enough water to quench hydropower’s “thirst.” Although it is the most water-rich part of the country, China’s southwest has been facing increasingly severe water shortages as climate change impacts the weather and rainfall patterns. Even if not affected by climate change, hydropower development in this <span class="toggle-layer bio">biodiversity-rich</span> region is still highly controversial as damming the rivers here would likely to destroy the regional ecosystems and terminate their ecoservices.</p>

        <h2>Changing Weather and Melting Glaciers</h2>
        <p>Yunnan Province, home to <strong>18</strong> of the planned dams, is in the midst of a five-year drought, of which climate change is a contributing factor. Already, factories in Guangdong Province have had to ration electricity consumption during the drought, because the electricity coming from Yunnan’s dams via the West-East Electricity Transfer Project was insufficient due to lower water levels.</p>

        <p>Besides drought and changing weather, a larger concern to Chinese planners is the ultimate water source for dams: Tibet’s glaciers. As the world’s average temperature rises, temperatures rise higher and faster in Tibet, which is accelerating the pace at which the glaciers melt. Furthermore, as China burns more coal and gasoline, more black carbon is spewed into the air, which increases the albedo of the glaciers, making them absorb more of the sun’s heat, instead of reflecting it back into space. This further causes the glaciers to melt faster, signifying a dwindling source of water for China’s southwestern dams.</p>

        <h2>Climate Mitigation at the Price of Adaptation</h2>
        <p>Constructing for climate mitigation, Chinese dams are actually a force against climate adaptation. <strong>XXX</strong> of China’s 60 new dams are to be built in areas that <a href="http://www.conservation.org/where/priority_areas/hotspots/Pages/hotspots_main.aspx">Conservation International</a> has identified as one of the world’s most critical <span class="toggle-layer bio">biodiversity hotspots</span> in Yunnan Province. What is critical about this area of southwest China is that the three parallel rivers of the Nu, Lancang, and Jinsha is a part of altitudinal corridors that connect tropical rainforests to the Tibetan Plateau. These corridors, sometimes referred to as “<strong>climate refugia</strong>,” allow species to easily migrate to cooler, more suitable climates as temperatures rise. Indeed, these corridors are nature’s own resiliency structures, ensuring that species can more easily adapt to climate change. However, dams in this region have already altered river flows, resulting in the decrease—even extinction—of fish species. The cascades of dams will, on one hand, submerge these corridors and thus impede species migration; on the other hand, they will dry up areas between reservoirs and make them unsuitable to inhabit. Hydropower projects have been and will keep posing irreversible harm to the vast river systems that stem from China’s southwest and reach to the heartlands of Asia.</p>
        <p>A wishful solution to climate change, hydropower is in fact reducing the odds for climate adaptation in certain parts of China, and impacting the nation’s water and ecological systems in the long run. Many of the existing, planned and under constructed dams in China’s southwest lack comprehensive environmental impact assessments and social impact assessments to fully understand their benefits as well as harms to sustainable development. Undervaluing ecosystems and their services has resulted in the prioritization of the more imminent need of carbon reduction in China, meanwhile ignoring the far-reaching ecological, social, and economic consequences of these hydropower projects. </p>
        <p>On December 24th, 2013 China’s environmental NGOs released a report on China’s Rivers called <a href="http://chinariversreport.org/">The “Last” Report for China’s Rivers</a>. Chinese civil society has spent the past decade working to protect China’s rivers, winning a valuable reprieve for the Nu in 2004 and cancellation of several projects over the years. The report is a comprehensive assessment of China’s rivers and the lessons of past unchecked hydropower development. Chinese environmental groups advocate for an urgent determination of ecological redlines for China’s rivers, and to ambitiously promote alternative energy so the health of China’s rivers will not sacrificed for its carbon reduction goals.</p>
